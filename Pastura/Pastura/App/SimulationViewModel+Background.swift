// MARK: - Background continuation
//
// Adds iOS 26+ BGContinuedProcessingTask integration to SimulationViewModel.
// See ADR-003 for the design and safe-reload pattern.
//
// Suspend/resume semantics (Step 13 / 14 / 15 / 16):
// - `handleWillResignActive` is the earliest suspend signal — fires before
//   scenePhase = .background, giving the GPU loop a head start on exiting
//   ahead of the iOS Metal-deny window.
// - `handleScenePhaseBackground` is a backstop to `handleWillResignActive`
//   and is toggle-agnostic: it always calls `suspendController?.requestSuspend()`.
//   The difference between Toggle ON and Toggle OFF manifests at BG task
//   activation time, not at suspend time.
// - Toggle ON: `handleBackgroundActivation` fires (because a BG request was
//   scheduled), reloads the model on CPU, then `resume()`s so the parked
//   generate retries on CPU.
// - Toggle OFF: no BG task activation. The parked generate stays parked
//   until `handleScenePhaseForeground` calls `resume()`. Partial KV-cache
//   cleanup on a Metal-induced decode failure is handled by the LLM layer
//   (`LlamaCppService.decodeFailureError` → `llama_memory_clear`) so the
//   retry on GPU starts from a clean state.
// - BG task expiration is deliberately NOT routed through the VM. The
//   manager completes the task synchronously and the SuspendController stays
//   paused until scenePhase = .active resumes it normally. See Step 15.
